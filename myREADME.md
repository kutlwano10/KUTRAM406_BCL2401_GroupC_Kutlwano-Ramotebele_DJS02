*Challenges* :
It was difficult to to put the red error message on the screen and when i checked using letters it was giving me NaN not the error Message. 

*Solutions*
I implemented a match regex method to check if the input match the symbols and letters. It was a success. 

*Improvements*
I want to improve the code further and not use so many if else statements. I need to work more on Logical Thinking, i need to improve my thinking cause seems like i always think small not smart and creative. I lack so i need to try to improve. Please Sir give me any feedback on this. I know i can do better
